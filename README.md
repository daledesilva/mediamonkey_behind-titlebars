Do you feel like your perfect layout is stuck behind titlebars?
Show and hide them all easily.

MediaMonkey 3 allows scripters to write great scripts which create panels that can be repositioned in the MediaMonkey window or even docked in it. However, while some of us take care in positioning them for the most efficiency or aesthetics, one they're in position, we most often don't need to see the titlebars of those panels anymore.
Sometimes scripters haven't programmed in a way to hide the titlebars in their scripts.

Behind Titlebars creates a submenu in the "view" dropdown which lets you show / hide titlebars from various other scripts installed.

- Behind Titlebars hides all titlebars immediately upon MediaMonkey starting.
- To show / hide titlebars quickly and easily, use the shortcut "ctrl + ~" or "ctrl + `" (The key next the "1" key at he top left of your keyboard.
